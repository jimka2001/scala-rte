%% Hi Jim,

%% We won't be able to do LaTex Beamer templates, so I'm attaching our logos in black and white.

%% For reference for the deck, the colors for Functional Scala are:
%% Dark blue: #0d307a
%% Light blue: #a6b9ff
%% White: #fffff
%% Black: #00000

%% BTW, if you'd like us to send over the shirt, please confirm the shipping details (and if you'd like a black or white one).

%% Thanks!
