# SCALA REGULAR-TYPE-EXPRESSIONS (RTE)

## Synopsis

This project contains the Scala implementation of Regular Type Expressions.

## Motivation

The implementation of rational type expression is the main result of this project.
However, several intermediate results might be useful as well, so they are made
available.

This project is an implementation of Rational Type Expressions originally implementedin Common Lisp.
